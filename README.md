# ScrapeTheNews
This python project aims to web scrape article information from different news sites using BeautifulSoup. This program is currently in development and so has some bugs, but it somewhat works for the Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, BBC and the New Zealand Herald.
##Setup
You will need to install BeautifulSoup, which can be found [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), in order to run the program.
##Use
To use, just run the python program for the news site of your choice, making sure to fill in the appropriate urllist file. Make sure to use Python 3.x, or the program will not work without some modifications(shown in comments; search for PYTHON CHECK).
