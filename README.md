# ScrapeTheNews
This python project has the goal of web scraping article information from different news sites using BeautifulSoup. This program is currently in development and so has some bugs, but it somewhat works for the New Zealand Herald, CNN, and BBC.
##Setup
You will need to install BeautifulSoup, which can be found [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), in order to run the program.
