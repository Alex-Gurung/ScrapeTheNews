Kiwis living in Vanuatu have described feeling a "strong but not severe" earthquake - but say there is no immediate reports of injury or damage.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said tsunami waves were possible for coasts within 300km of the epicentre following the 7.2 quake. It was centered about 81km northwest of Port-Olry, a town in the Sanma province on the island of Espiritu Santo.Since then the quake has been downgraded to 6.9 and the PTWC said the threat of a tsunami has now largely passed and there is no concern in New Zealand.New Zealander Craig Arlidge, who manages Moyyan House by the Sea on the island of Espiritu Santo, said he "felt the wall shake for about five seconds" and water sloshed about in the rain water tank.He said his wife was reading a book and jumped out of bed.Owner of Barrier Beach House on Espiritu Santo Calvin Rhodes said the quake felt "strong but not severe"."We're in a concrete house; everything was shaking," he said."The guests were all sitting down for dinner but everyone was fine. Nothing went flying and there wasn't any damage."Vanuatu sits on the Ring of Fire, the arc of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes are common.

An American tourist has been left with little more than the clothes on her back after her car was stolen with all her belongings inside - including her beloved ukulele, and her camera full of travel snaps.Danica Klas, 21, from Oregon, doesn't even have a pair of shoes - everything she owned, including her backpack full of clothes, sleeping bag, her ukulele, camera, and iPad, were inside the car. She's been left with the dress she was wearing, her phone, wallet, a journal, and her passport.Ms Klas has been in New Zealand since September - working in Queenstown and volunteering on a farm in west Auckland, with a road trip in between - and was about to set off on some more adventures around the North Island when the car she's been travelling and living in was stolen while she stayed at a friend's house in the Auckland suburb of Mt Eden on Saturday night.A number of cars were broken into on Marsden Ave during the night, and Ms Klas's dark blue Subaru Legacy station wagon, registration CJY 570, was stolen."It was gone, and there was a car abandoned," she told theNeighbours reported hearing the car at around 3am, she said."It was right under the street lights, I didn't think anything would happen it ... because it's such a nice neighbourhood," Ms Klas said."And stupid me left my camera, my ukulele, all my electronics [inside]. The only thing I have with me, luckily, is my wallet and my phone, and a dress. I don't even have shoes."The Canon camera had been a present for her to go travelling with - the first time Ms Klas has gone beyond her home state of Oregon's borders - and had around 5000 photos on it.When she realised the car was gone, she said it felt "really surreal", and didn't register until she came back into her friend's house to tell them what happened."I came to tell these guys and I just kinda lost it, and I cried," she said."It's just everything, everything I've been travelling with, all my photos, everything collected, my instrument, which was really dear to me."She added: "I had like shells and rocks I collected, just things that may not seem of value to other people but are really important to me."I don't think it's worth anything to them, so if my car turns up somewhere maybe my stuff will still be in it."She was surprised by the theft because New Zealand felt safe, she said, and she had left the car for five days while she trekked in Abel Tasman National Park with no problems."I was just saying yesterday that it's so good travelling in New Zealand because it's so safe, nothing bad happens, and then the next day this happened."She reported the theft to police, but says she "doesn't have a lot of hope".Ms Klas fought back tears as she delivered this message to the car thieves: "If they want the engine, they can have the engine. I just really want my photos back and some clothes, and my instrument, and all the things that people gave me while I was travelling New Zealand that I won't be able to [replace]."That would be really nice if I could have that stuff back."For now her travel plans have been put on hold - she's ringing travel agents to cancel her tickets for Hobbiton and a White Island tour which she had booked in advance - as she weighs up her options. But once thing's for sure, she's not leaving New Zealand because of it."I don't think I would want to leave too early, just because I love it here. I only get one year here and I don't want to waste it. I don't want them to ruin my trip."Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletterView on our:Teen girl's body found on Otorohanga road: 'It is just heartbreaking' - National - NZ Herald News
A 17-year-old who was found dead on the side of a road this morning had spent the night at a good friend's birthday party.Police are now investigating what happened to the teenager, who was found by a member of the public, and whether a car was involved in her death.The mother of the birthday girl told the Herald the teen had had a nice evening at the party, spending time with her friends and cousins. Her father was also at the party and spent most of the night there "waiting for her"."She was all good. She's a quiet girl, always smiling. She wasn't drinking, or falling around like that.She was just her usual self."The teen is from a very tight-knit family and was in Year 13 at Te Kuiti College.A passerby found the girl lying on the grass on State Highway 3, just north of the King Country township. It was 6.30am and she was dead.Detective Senior Sergeant Ross Patterson said debris indicated that a vehicle was involved, and the teen had "collided" with it.Last night, police were still trying to identify the vehicle.Resident Lauren Zanders said she had heard a car whizzing past her property early in the morning."I got woken up some time in the wee hours of the morning by a car doing a burn-out down the road. The only thing I heard apart from that was a crowd of people saying 'chug, chug' at a party down the road."I'm just so sad that someone's baby was taken away. It is just heartbreaking."Mr Patterson said a post-mortem examination would take place in Auckland tomorrow.Police officers spent part of the day knocking on doors within a cordon covering a large section of SH3, which runs through the centre of Otorohanga. A blue tent had been erected inside the cordon and yellow numbered markers dotted the road.Mr Patterson said the police wanted to hear from anyone with information."We expect that as our investigation progresses, we will find out more about how she came to be there and the circumstances of her death. This is a tragedy and our thoughts are with her family at this time."Otorohanga District Mayor Max Baxter called for the community to stick together and support one another."This is a very close community and we've got a wonderful group of young people in this town."- additional reporting: Cherie HowieReceive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletterView on our:
