David Cameron had stake in father's offshore trust - BBC News
David Cameron has said he and his wife Samantha owned shares in an offshore trust set up by his late father, before selling them for £30,000 in 2010.The PM has faced questions over Blairmore Holdings, an offshore company set up by his late father, Ian.HeLabour said the PM had been forced into the "extraordinary admission".The BBC understands Mr Cameron will publish his tax returns, possibly next week.There have been days of headlines about Blairmore Holdings, a fund for investors which, until 2006, used "bearer shares" to protect its clients' privacy, following the leak of 11 million documents held by Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.They show that Ian Cameron, who died in 2010, was one of five UK directors who flew to board meetings in the Bahamas or Switzerland.On Wednesday, Downing Street issued a statement sayingOn Thursday Mr Cameron told ITV News: "I don't have anything to hide. I'm proud of my dad and what he did and the business he established... I can't bear to see his name being dragged through the mud."The PM said it had been a "difficult few days, reading criticisms of my father and his business practices - my dad, a man I love and admire and miss every day".Mr Cameron said much criticism was based on a "fundamental misconception" that Blairmore Investment was set up to avoid tax."It wasn't. It was set up after exchange controls went, so that people who wanted to invest in dollar denominated shares and companies could do so, and there are many other, thousands of other unit trusts set up in this way," he said.Mr Cameron said the fund was "properly audited" and reported to the Inland Revenue every year. Anyone who bought units in it was subject to capital gains tax when shares were sold, he said.He said that he had owned stocks and shares in the past but sold them in 2010 shortly before he became prime minister."I didn't want to anyone to say you've got other agendas or vested interests," he said."Samantha and I had a joint account and we owned 5,000 units in Blairmore investment trust which we sold in January 2010, that was worth something like £30,000."I paid income tax on the dividends, but there was a profit on it, but that was less than the capital gains tax allowance, so I didn't pay capital gains tax, but it was subject to all the UK taxes in all the normal ways."Downing Street said Mr and Mrs Cameron bought their holding in April 1997 for £12,497 and sold it in January 2010 for £31,500. That year the personal allowance before capital gains tax was paid was £10,100 per person.A leak of 11.5 million documents has lifted the lid on how the rich and powerful use tax havens to hide their wealth.The files were leaked from one of the world's most secretive companies, a Panamanian law firm called Mossack Fonseca.Among the files are details about:The scandalMossack Fonseca says it has operated beyond reproach for 40 years and never been accused or charged with criminal wrong-doing.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said that while there was no suggestion of illegality, it would be "politically embarrassing" for Mr Cameron to be associated with a company which did not pay tax in the UK, at a time when he was trying to encourage overseas territories to be more transparent about tax and was trying to clamp down on tax havens.Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said it was an "extraordinary admission": "David Cameron, who described the use of complex tax avoidance schemes as "morally wrong", has been forced to admit that he held shares in a fund now linked to tax avoidance."He said there would be further questions about what Mr Cameron knew about the fund: "The time has come for David Cameron to put the record straight rather than having details dragged from him in instalments."He told BBC News: "It feels like the prime minister is governing from the shadows in this announcement today. That he's been withholding personal information that he feels personal shame about."And SNP economy spokesman Stewart Hosie MP described it as "an astounding revelation by a prime minister who has questioned the morality of using such tax-avoiding schemes".He added: "David Cameron says he doesn't have anything to hide, yet had it not been for the Panama Papers leak we would have been none the wiser - and even then it has taken him several days to clarify he benefited from his father's off-shore trust."Prime Minister David Cameron says he and his wife owned shares in an offshore trust set up by his late father, before selling them for £30,000 in 2010.Why are these train tracks driving people off the rails?The tragedy that 'chemsex' drugs can causeParental leave - San Fran v rest of worldAnalysing the film choices of presidential candidatesThe growing use of tiny predators to tackle farm pestsWe race both across Delhi to find out which is fasterMy daughter was murdered because she was a lesbianHow to strike it rich hunting security breaches on the netJessica Raine lives the science fiction dream in XShakespeare First Folio discovered on Scottish island - BBC News
A copy of Shakespeare's First Folio, one of the most sought-after books in the world, has been discovered in a stately home on a Scottish island.This copy of the first collected edition of Shakespeare's plays, published in 1623, was found at Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute.Academics who authenticated the book called it a rare and significant find.About 230 copies of the First Folio are known to exist. A copy owned by Oxford University sold for £3.5m in 2003.Emma Smith, professor of Shakespeare studies at Oxford University, said her first reaction on being told the stately home was claiming to have an original First Folio was: "Like hell they have."But when she inspected the three-volume book she found it was authentic."We've found a First Folio that we didn't know existed," said Prof Smith.The goatskin-bound book will now go on public display at the stately home for the first time.Adam Ellis-Jones, director of the Mount Stuart House Trust, said the identification of this original First Folio was "genuinely astonishing".The discovery comes ahead of the 400th anniversary of the playwright's death.The First Folio, printed seven years after Shakespeare's death, brought together 36 plays - 18 of which would otherwise not have been recorded.Without this publication, there would be no copy of plays such as Macbeth, Twelfth Night, Julius Caesar, As You Like It and The Tempest.The book is also the only source of the familiar dome-headed portrait of Shakespeare by Martin Droeshout.Prof Smith, author of Shakespeare's First Folio: Four Centuries of an Iconic Book, says it is uncertain how many copies were produced - although some put the figure at about 750.About 230 copies are known still to exist. The last copy found was two years ago, in what had been a Jesuit library in St Omer in France.The Isle of Bute discovery adds another, but there is uncertainty about where this copy had spent much of the four centuries since being printed.It had been owned by an 18th Century literary editor and then appears in the Bute library collection in 1896.Alice Martin, Mount Stuart's head of historic collections, believes it was bought by the third Marquess of Bute, an antiquarian and collector, who died in 1900.The trust, which runs the Gothic revival house, had been researching the collection of books, paintings and historic items and called in experts from Oxford University to assess the authenticity of what had been claimed as a First Folio.Apart from its cultural value, verification makes the book extremely valuable. A copy owned by Oriel College, Oxford sold for about £3.5m in 2003, while another copy sold at auction in 2006 for about £2.8m.Authenticating a copy involves a series of technical checks on, among other things, the watermarked paper and printing process.Imperfections are also part of the identification, as real copies can include the inky thumbprints of Jacobean printers.Misspellings also appear, sometimes corrected after proofreading.There is a stage direction in King Lear, which, in the early part of the print run, says rather cryptically "Prof Smith says there are also many fake copies.Authentications are further complicated by high-quality reproductions produced by a 19th Century craftsman, John Harris.He was hired by the British Museum to replace missing or damaged pages or sections of old books, including for First Folios - and was so skilled that it is uncertain how much of his work might now be accepted as authentic.Prof Smith suggests not even all the officially catalogued First Folios may be authentic.The story of the First Folio, she says, usually focuses on the literary genius of Shakespeare, but the survival of his plays depended on the practical skills of the people who produced this book."The vast majority of plays from this period have been lost, because they were never printed," she says.The preservation of much of Shakespeare's work depended on the publishers of the First Folio copying, collating and editing from whatever hand-written scripts and first-hand memories were still available in the 1620s.As Shakespeare's reputation grew, the value of the First Folio increased, with the book becoming highly prized by collectors.In the 19th Century and early 20th Century many copies were bought by US railway millionaires, financiers and oil tycoons.Mr Ellis-Jones says identifying a First Folio at Mount Stuart indicates how much remains to be examined in one of the "last great unknown collections"."We knew that we had special things here, but we keep discovering how special - because it's never been researched and never been in the public eye."Ms Martin says an "abundance of mysteries" remain. "We've got completely unexplored collections."She says there has always been something "quite eccentric" about the house.As well as being an art collector, the third marquess introduced exotic wildlife to the island, including kangaroos. The last of these exiled marsupials died when it was hit by the island's first car.And are any more First Folios likely to appear?"I'm sure there are a few more out there," says Prof Smith. "I don't think they're in people's lofts, even though it would be lovely and romantic."I think they're in libraries which have been neglected or forgotten, I suspect more will be in mainland Europe."Prime Minister David Cameron says he and his wife owned shares in an offshore trust set up by his late father, before selling them for £30,000 in 2010.Why are these train tracks driving people off the rails?The tragedy that 'chemsex' drugs can causeParental leave - San Fran v rest of worldAnalysing the film choices of presidential candidatesThe growing use of tiny predators to tackle farm pestsWe race both across Delhi to find out which is fasterMy daughter was murdered because she was a lesbianHow to strike it rich hunting security breaches on the netJessica Raine lives the science fiction dream in XUS election: Tensions escalate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders - BBC News
Hillary Clinton has dismissed as "ridiculous" a charge by Bernie Sanders that she is "unqualified" to be president, as tensions rise in the Democratic race.The Vermont senator stood by his comments, pointing to her Wall Street links and her vote for the war in Iraq.He said she started the latest war of words by attacking him first.The two candidates will do battle in a New York showdown in two weeks, a state where both have strong links.There is much at stake, as the former secretary of state tries to stem the momentum of the self-described democratic socialist, who has a string of wins behind him.Mr Sanders beat Mrs Clinton in the Wisconsin primary contest on Tuesday, and could pick up more delegates in Wyoming on Saturday before the greater prize of New York is up for grabs.Is it a sign of desperation from a losing campaign or a proportional response to an earlier unfair attack? Whatever the reason, Bernie Sanders's recent criticisms of Hillary Clinton as "unqualified" for the presidency represent a marked escalation in the war of words between the two candidates.Mrs Clinton's supporters are bristling at the remarks, which they consider both sexist and patently untrue, given the former secretary of state's weighty political biography.The Vermont senator's point, however, is that Mrs Clinton's lengthy experience within the establishment isn't a mark in her favour, it's a flaw that makes her beholden to the special interests he has spent his campaign denouncing.With what could be a decisive New York primary less than two weeks away, the battle lines are clearly forming and the rhetoric is only just starting to heat up.Democrats often boast of the substantiveness of their presidential nomination contest, particularly compared to the ongoing Republican slugfest.This relatively genteel atmosphere may not persist through a rough-and-tumble contest in the Empire State, however, with its tabloid media culture that trumpets every squawk and squabble. In the political pressure cooker that is New York politics, things may be about to take an ugly turn.The latest row began on Wednesday when Mrs Clinton was asked if Mr Sanders was qualified to be president, after he gave a newspaper interview in which he appeared to struggle to answer some questions."I think he hadn't done his homework and he'd been talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hasn't really studied or understood, and that does raise a lot of questions," she told MSNBC's Morning Joe.On Wednesday night, Bernie Sanders told a crowd of supporters at Temple University that Mrs Clinton had accused him of being unqualified."Well let me, let me just say in response to Secretary Clinton, I don't believe that she is qualified if she is, through her super PAC [fundraising committee], taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds," he said."I don't think you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your super PAC."He went on to list her backing of the Iraq War and her support of trade agreements as other disqualifications. On Thursday, he repeated his comments.The Clinton campaign hit back, with spokesman Brian FallonOne of her senior aides, Christina Reynolds, said it was "a ridiculous and irresponsible attack for someone to make" against one of the most qualified candidates ever to run.On the campaign trail, Mrs Clinton told Politico she explains things in a way more "open and truthful than my opponent," and said she explains what she would do as president rather than "lots of arm-waving and hot rhetoric".In the Republican race, the two front-runners Ted Cruz and Donald Trump also traded insults on the campaign trail in New York.Mr Trump, a businessman with no experience of elected office, accused the Texas senator of "hating" the city when he accused Mr Trump of having "New York values".The hashtag was trending on Twitter and Facebook after Mr Sanders' comments, started by a Clinton supporter. It was meant to be supportive, but not all of the tweets showed Mrs Clinton in a positive light:Prime Minister David Cameron says he and his wife owned shares in an offshore trust set up by his late father, before selling them for £30,000 in 2010.Why are these train tracks driving people off the rails?The tragedy that 'chemsex' drugs can causeParental leave - San Fran v rest of worldAnalysing the film choices of presidential candidatesThe growing use of tiny predators to tackle farm pestsWe race both across Delhi to find out which is fasterMy daughter was murdered because she was a lesbianHow to strike it rich hunting security breaches on the netJessica Raine lives the science fiction dream in X
